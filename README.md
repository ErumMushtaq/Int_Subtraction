# Int_Subtraction

Demo file is the main file.

It performs the following tasks:

     1) loads 4 coil brain data (borrowed from AC LORAKS data set) 
     
     2) Perform transform formation in calibration phase
     
     3) Use that transform in Acquisition phase to remove the interference.
     
     4) Interference signals are BPSK signals.

Demo file file is dependent on the following functions

     1) Sense R1 to perform optimal coil combination
     
     2) BPSK.m to generate Interference signal
